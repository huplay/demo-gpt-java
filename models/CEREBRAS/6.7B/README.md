# CEREBRAS-6.7B parameters

(Cerebras)

You can download the parameter files from this repo: https://huggingface.co/cerebras/Cerebras-GPT-6.7B

Download and unzip the content of the following file to the `parameters` folder: /blob/main/pytorch_model.bin

This `pytorch_model.bin` file is a standard PK ZIP file. Possibly you have to rename it to `.zip` and extract the files under the `archive/data` folder.

You will find files named as 8 or 9 digit long numbers.
(The mapping was created using the info in the `archive/data.pkl` pickle file.)
